// Primitive Types and Reference Types in JavaScript

// Facts

/*
 * -- JavaScript has 2 kinds of variable types: primitive and reference:
 * -- A fixed amount of memory is reserved after creation of every variable.
 * -- When a variable is copied, it's in-memory value is copied.
 * -- Passing a variable to a function via a call also creates a copy of that variable.
 */


/*  Primitive Types: 
 *  The in-memory value of a primitive type is it's actual value (e.g. boolean true, number 42). 
 *  A primitive type can be stored in the fixed amount of memory available. 
 *  null
 *  undefined
 *  Boolean
 *  Number
 *  String
 * Primitive types are also known as: scalar types or simple types.
 */


/** Reference Types
 *  A reference type can contain other values. Since the contents of a reference type can not fit in the fixed amount 
 *  of memory available for a variable, the in-memory value of a reference type is the reference itself (a memory address).
 *  Array
 *  Object
 *  Function
 *  Reference types are also known as: complex types or container types.
